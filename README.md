the Firefox profile directory‚Äîwhich can be found by opening `about:support`.

## üçé macOS preferences

chezmoi will run the [`run_onchange_macos.sh`](run_onchange_macos.sh) script
to apply custom macOS preferences.
It may be necessary to log out and back in for preferences to take effect.

## üîë SSH keys

Unique SSH keys are used for each host/service and [managed with 1Password][op-ssh].
[`.ssh/config`](private_dot_ssh/config) has been configured with `IdentitiesOnly`
and `IdentityFile` to use the specific key for each host as described in the
[1Password docs][op-ssh-config].

[op-ssh]: https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh
[op-ssh-config]: https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent/advanced#ssh-server-six-key-limit
